# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the product catalog with four additional fashion items to provide more collection variety.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 4 new premium fashion products (crewneck sweatshirt, chino pants, oxford shirt, wool scarf) to the backend products array
- Ensure new products automatically display in the existing product grid layout
- Maintain consistent product structure with unique IDs, names, prices ($25-$150 range), and descriptions

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse and add 8 total products to their shopping cart instead of the original 4, with all new items displayed in the same responsive grid.
