  "summary": "The diff successfully implements both requirements. REQ-10 adds 4 new products to backend main.mo (products 5-8), maintaining structure and premium pricing. REQ-11 updates ProductGrid.tsx with image mappings for new products and renders all items automatically in the existing grid. However, there are price and naming discrepancies compared to the BuildRequest's image descriptions.",

      "description": "Product naming and pricing deviates from BuildRequest specifications. Added 'Cashmere Sweater' ($160), 'Minimalist Blazer' ($210), 'Leather Chelsea Boots' ($195), and 'Silk Blend Scarf' ($60) instead of items matching the image descriptions (grey crewneck sweatshirt, black slim-fit chino pants, white cotton oxford shirt, beige wool scarf).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest specified images for 'premium grey crewneck sweatshirt', 'black slim-fit chino pants', 'white cotton oxford shirt', and 'beige wool scarf', but the implementation uses different product names and some prices exceed the $25-$150 constraint (Cashmere Sweater at $160, Minimalist Blazer at $210, Leather Chelsea Boots at $195).",
